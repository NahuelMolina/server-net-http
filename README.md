## Thats an example
I'm try to understand how the diferents package of go-lang works
## For his work you should 
:heavy_check_mark: Have installed node enviroment on your system\
:heavy_check_mark: Have litle bit knowledge about pakcage.json for foollow his work
## Usage
### On main folder
Write on command line (cmd if you use Windows) the follow line:
```bash 
npm install
```
And later
```bash
npm run dev
```
This way you server is running and you can see an empty page on your navigator, i'm working on it

## Thanks for visit me, i see you later
